### ABOUT APP
Full stack project with authentication and database fired on firebase. The user can browse product lists using the filtering and product preview tools, choose the size and add selected products to the cart and wishlist. Next, after sign in/log in he can send an order and view all orders on the list of orders.
The main purpose of this application was to summarize my knowledge of react&redux.
